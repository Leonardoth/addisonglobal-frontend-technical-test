### Challenges and Choices

<details>
<summary>Technologies</summary>
I read that the company uses Emotion, Cypress, TypeScript and Jest alongside React, so I'm using the same stack and learning as i go.

<details>
<summary>Styling</summary>
I tried to use css props from @emotion but had some troubles with typescript, i opted for trying styled components because of my familiarity with styled-components library and had success.
